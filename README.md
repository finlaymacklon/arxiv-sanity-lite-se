# arxiv-sanity-lite-se 

A fork of [`arxiv-sanity-lite`](https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-lite) for software engineering papers. 

Currently in the process of integrating this with [`DatasetSEVenues`](https://github.com/ZeinabAk/DatasetSEVenues) to include published SE papers too. A better name could be `se-papers-sanity` when this is complete and working.

[Bug fixes and feature addition TODOs can be found here](TODO.md).

*Pull requests/contributons are welcome. Just make sure to compare across forks instead of making a pull request to the original `arxiv-sanity-lite` :P*
