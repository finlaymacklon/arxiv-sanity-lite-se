# find-se-papers

## About

A fork of [`karpathy/arxiv-sanity-lite`](https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-lite) for software engineering papers. Intended to complement arXiv and Google Scholar.

Partially integrated this with [`ZeinabAk/DatasetSEVenues`](https://github.com/ZeinabAk/DatasetSEVenues) to include published SE papers too. Have not yet loaded in all links to papers from that dataset, but do have many.
